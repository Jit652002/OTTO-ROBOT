The Obstacle Otto robot is a simple yet efficient robotic model designed to detect and avoid obstacles autonomously.
Equipped with ultrasonic sensors, it can measure distances and detect objects in its path, triggering a response to change direction and avoid collisions. 
The robot's design emphasizes basic principles of robotics, integrating sensors, microcontrollers, and mobility components.
Its straightforward mechanism and compact size make it ideal for educational purposes, allowing students to explore fundamental concepts in robotics, programming, and automation.
